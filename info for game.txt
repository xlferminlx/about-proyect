# Tools for my game 


## 1. Project Management  
- **Trello**: A Kanban board for task tracking and workflow organization.  
- **Notion**: Used for documentation, notes, and project planning.  

## 2. Version Control & Storage  
- **Google Drive**:  
  - Primary storage for project files, documentation, and backups.  
  - Ensures accessibility across devices without needing a local repository.  

## 3. Game Engine and Development Tools  
- **Unreal Engine 5**:  
  - Chosen for its high-fidelity graphics and Blueprint system.  
  - No external libraries will be used; development will focus on plugins.  
- **Visual Studio 2022**:  
  - For Unreal Engine C++ development due to its debugging capabilities and integration.  

## 4. Software Design  
- **Draw.io**: For UML class diagrams and system architecture design.  
- **Miro**: Used for brainstorming story structures and flowcharts.  

## 5. Asset Creation  
- **Blender**: For creating 3D models and assets.  
- **Adobe Photoshop/GIMP**: For textures and UI elements.  
- **Quixel Megascans**: To integrate high-quality assets into the game.  
- **Mixamo**:  
  - Used for 3D character models and animations to speed up development.  
  - Provides pre-rigged models and motion-captured animations compatible with Unreal Engine.  

## 6. Plugins  
- Instead of external libraries, I will implement Unreal Engine plugins to extend functionality, including:  
  - **Gameplay Ability System (GAS)** for advanced character mechanics.  
  - **Niagara** for visual effects and particle systems.  
  - **Metahuman** (if needed) for high-quality character models.  

## 7. Testing  
- **Unreal Engine Testing Framework**: Built-in unit testing framework for gameplay mechanics.
